<br>Creating a JSON object that contains at least 4 aspects (name, description, image, short story, age when I fell in love with it) - includes an svg accordingly. The three "things" are represented with an interactive control on the page (button in this case) - when the user engages with the control, it shows more data about the selected "thing".
<br>The controls use the JSON object as their data source - uses the Fetch API to retrieve the object on page load and immediately update the view/interface.
